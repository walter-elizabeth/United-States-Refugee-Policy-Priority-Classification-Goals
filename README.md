# United States Refugee Policy- Priority Classification Goals
MSU Course SSC 442 - Social Science Data Analytics Applications Assignment: Create an Infographic Poster

Instructions:
1. Download the Department of Homeland Security’s annual count of people granted refugee status between 2006-2015:
2. Clean the data.
3. Summarize the data somehow.
4. Create an appropriate time-based visualization based on the data.
Don’t just calculate overall averages or totals per country—the visualization needs to deal with change over time, and it needs to illustrate something non-obvious and insightful in the data. Do as much polishing and refining in R—make adjustments to the colors, scales, labels, grid lines, and even fonts, etc. You may have more than one visualization, but only one is required.

5. Refine and polish the saved image, adding annotations, changing colors, and otherwise enhancing it.
6. Design and create an infographic “poster”.
Have a polished plot with an interesting insight from the data, a polished layout to make it attractive, and a polished 2-4 paragraphs that sets up the plot and elaborates on your insight.

For this assignment, we are less concerned with the code and more concerned with the design. Choose good colors based on palettes. Choose good, clean fonts. Use the heck out of theme(). Add informative design elements. Make it look beautiful.
